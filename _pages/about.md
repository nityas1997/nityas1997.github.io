I am a PhD stsudent in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/) at [Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey](https://www.rutgers.edu/). I am advised by [Prof. Anand D. Sarwate](https://adsarwate.github.io/). I also work with [Prof. Roy Yates](https://www.winlab.rutgers.edu/~ryates/) and [Prof. Narayan Mandayam](https://www.winlab.rutgers.edu/~narayan/index.html). I completed by Bachelors in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from RV College of Engineering in 2019. My research interests involve studying balancing privacy and timeliness ( age of information) in communication systems. I am also currently working on a project to study privacy and age-driven offloading in mobile edge systems.
